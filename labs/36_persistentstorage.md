## Lab 3.6: Persistent Storage

In this lab we are going to install [Longhorn](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn), a Cloud-Native distributed block storage. Longhorn is a [CNCF Sandbox](https://thenewstack.io/rancher-donates-its-longhorn-kubernetes-persistent-storage-software-to-cncf/) Project, we do not yet recommend this in a production setup. For this lab purpose, its an easy solution to provide storage to your Pods.


## Install Project Longhorn using Rancher App Catalog

Go to your system project and open the "Apps" page. Search for Longhorn and launce a new longhorn instance. You can leave all settings on default.

As soon as your longhorn instance is "Active", you can open the longhorn webgui to see all nodes and volumes. There should be no volume at the moment.

## Create a new Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)

Longhorn does also create a new Storage Class as marks it as the default storage class.

For testing, we are going to create a new Volume. Go to the "Default" Project and open the page "Resources/Workload" and then switch to the "Volumes" tab. Click on add Volume.

![Add Volume Claim](../resources/images/addvolume.png)

Create a new `test` volume with 1 GiB Size. In the Longhorn Webgui you should see now a new Volume which is Detached (as we have not yet mounted the volume in a pod):

## Mount the volume inside a pod

You can now create a new Pod and mount the volume. Create a new Deployment inside your default Namespace. Give it a name `test` and use the `busybox` container image. You can now select the already existing PVC under Volumes ("Add Volume" / "Use existing persistent volume") and select the previusly created PVC. You can mount the volume at `/mnt`. Launch de deployment and open a shell from the newly created pod to verify the mountpoint (e.g. `df -h`).

![Add Volume](../resources/images/mountvolume.png)

Inside the Longhorn Webgui, you should see that the volume is getting attached and as soon as it is attached you can verify all replicas for this volume.
