# Lab 4.2: Rancher Server Restoration

With the previously created etcd snapshot you can fully restore your Rancher Control Plane. Check the [Rancher Documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/backups/restorations/ha-restoration/) for detailed explenation and a full disaster recovery.


### Restore an etcd Snapshot


The etcd snapshot is restored again with `rke`:

rke etcd snapshot-restore --name <snapshot>.db --config ./rancher-cluster-restore.yml
```
