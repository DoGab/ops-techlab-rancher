# Lab 5.2: Rancher Project Monitoring

Project monitoring allows you to view the state of pods running in a given project. Prometheus collects metrics from the project’s deployed HTTP and TCP/UDP workloads.

Check the [Rancher Documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/project-admin/tools/monitoring/) for more details.


## Enable Project Monitoring

Only administrators, cluster owners or members, or project owners can configure project level monitoring. Project members can only view monitoring metrics.

* From the Global view, navigate to the project that you want to configure project monitoring.
* Select Tools > Monitoring in the navigation bar.
* Select Enable to show the Prometheus configuration options. Enter in your desired configuration options.
* Click Save.

When all components of the project monitoring are deployed, you can open the workload metrics by clicking on the grafana icon within your Workload view.
