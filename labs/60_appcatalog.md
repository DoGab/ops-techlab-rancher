# Lab 6: App Catalog

Rancher provides the ability to use a catalog of Helm charts that make it easy to repeatedly deploy applications.

* Catalogs are GitHub repositories or Helm Chart repositories filled with applications that are ready-made for deployment. Applications are bundled in objects called Helm charts.
* Helm charts are a collection of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources. A single chart might be used to deploy something simple, like a memcached pod, or something complex, like a full web app stack with HTTP servers, databases, caches, and so on.

For more details, check the [Rancher Documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/catalog/)
